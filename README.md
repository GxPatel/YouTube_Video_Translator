# NJIT: Intro to AI project

The "YouTube Video Translator" project is a tool designed to take a YouTube video link and translate its captions into 10 different languages chosen by the user. It displays the translated output in three columns: the time stamps, the original captions, and the corresponding translated captions. This project utilizes AI to facilitate multilingual accessibility and understanding of video content, enabling users to experience videos in their preferred languages.

You can run the application using following command in your python interpretor:
"streamlit run app.py"
